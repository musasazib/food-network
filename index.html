            <p>I was born in USSR, the country which doesnâ€™t exist anymore, nevertheless it is still hard for me to
                differentiate the dishes I prepare (and my mom prepares, and my grand mom does till now) by various
                countries cuisines they are supposed to be belong to.
                <br>you can find dishes from various eastern European cuisines on my website.

        <p class="recipie-heading">It looks like nowadays not many people have time and/or mood to cook food at home.
            <br> And I think, even less of them are actually enjoying the process of making home food, they probably
            think.
            <br>
            making food is hard or boring.
